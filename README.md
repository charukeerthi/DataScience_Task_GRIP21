# Student Percentage Prediction

Student Percentage Prediction is a Data Science project. It is a project where we are going to provide accurate prediction and insights about the given `student data`. Here the prediction occurs using Supervised Machine Learning so it uses Simple linear Regression to build a model to predict percentage score of students when the studying hours is given as input.

## Introduction

- We have given students dataset, which have only two features Hours and scores.
- By using the dataset predict the percentage of an student based on number of study hours.
- This is simple linear regression task because it involves just 2 variables.
- We can use R, python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
- Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

## Problem Description

A dataset is formed by taking into consideration some of the information of 25 Students. Based on the given information about each student we have to Predict the percentage of an student based on number of study hours.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 25 students data.
There are 3 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 12 columns.

- _Hours_ - Number of hours a student has studied

- _Scores_ - Number of marks the student has achieved

## Technology

- Language : `Python`
- Software : `Jupyter Notebook`
- Libraries : `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn`
- Web Browser : `Mozilla, Google Chrome, IE8, OPERA`

## How to run the K-means Clustering of University Project

1. Download the file

2. Extract the file and copy Heart Disease Prediction folder

3. Type `cmd` in the Address Bar to open command prompt

4. Open Jupyter Notebook using `jupyter notebook`

5. Open the file named '_Task_1_'

7. Run the script using `Run` button

## Conclusion

- We have successfully created a Simple linear Regression model to predict percentage score of students given number of hours one studied.

- By computing the MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and MSE(Mean Squared Error) , we are not getting much difference in actual and predicted value that means error is less.
- The Score of R-Square is 0.93 which is quite close to 1.

# Optimum Number of Cluster Prediction

Optimum Number of Cluster Prediction is a Data Science project. It is a project where we are going to provide accurate prediction and insights about the given `Iris data`. Here the prediction occurs using Unsupervised Machine Learning so it uses K-Means algorithm to build a model to predict optimum number of cluster when the iris flower features are given as input.

## Introduction

- We are given the iris flower dataset, with features sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.
- Our aim is to create a K means clustering classifier to classify the flower in categories that are : _Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica_.
- Here, Python language is used to build the classifier.
- Dataset link : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

## Problem Description

A dataset is formed by taking into consideration some of the information of 150 iris flowers. Based on the given information about each iris flower we have to Predict the optimum number of cluster based on iris flower features.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 150 iris flowers data.
There are 6 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 5 columns.

- _SepalLengthCm_ - Displays the Sepal length in cm (unit)

- _SepalWidthCm_ - Displays the Sepal width in cm (unit)

- _PetalLengthCm_ - Displays the Petal length in cm (unit)

- _PetalWidthCm_ - Displays the Petal width in cm (unit)

- _Species_ - Displays the species of the iris flower

## Technology

- Language : `Python`
- Software : `Jupyter Notebook`
- Libraries : `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn`
- Web Browser : `Mozilla, Google Chrome, IE8, OPERA`

## How to run the Optimum Number of Cluster Prediction Project

1. Download the file

2. Extract the file and copy Heart Disease Prediction folder

3. Type `cmd` in the Address Bar to open command prompt

4. Open Jupyter Notebook using `jupyter notebook`

5. Open the file named '_Task_2_'

7. Run the script using `Run` button

## Conclusion

- Using Petal length and Petal width features, we can distinguish _Iris Setosa_ flowers from others.
- Separating versicolor from virginica is quite hard as they have few datapoints considerably overlapped.
